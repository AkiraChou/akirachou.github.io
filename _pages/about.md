Hey Hi! Thanks for visiting my website.

I'm currently a Data Scientist at the U.S. Small Business Administration.

I am interested in how we make decisions and how we can improve them with data. Some subjects that fascinate me include behavioral economics, data science, and data engineering. I also interested in how we can leverage technology and self-interested behavior for social good.

When I'm not working you might find me trying out new ice cream from the grocery store, listening to economics/news/science podcasts, or getting to know new people (like you!) - so please feel free to contact me. You can find out more about why I chose to create this website [here](/posts/2023/08/blog-post-1/).
